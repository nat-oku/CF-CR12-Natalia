https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git.

Please remember to include the DataBase as well with the option create a database and dumps included, NOT SEPARATED.

DB essential columns: locationName, price, description, longitude, latitude.

 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(40) make a CRUD (create/read/update/delete) for the offers

(20) create a details file, when you click on any offer it will lead you to a page that will show more info about the offer that you clicked on.

(20)  in the details page, you need to use google map API to locate the location of the offer (remember that your database should have the columns longitude and latitude)

(20) use Serriâ€™s jokes API to show a joke in the navbar every time the page is loaded. There should be a button that when clicked will show another joke (AJAX must be used for this task)

Bonus points:

(20) From the database that was built, create an API that will return details (i.e.: location name and price ) from all offers from your agency.
